# Powerops
Set of PowerShell commands to help in the operation of IIS/ASP.NET applications

Description
-------
In any improvement effort, the first recommended step is explore and to answer where are we standding on (to explore and to analize our current state) in addition to where would us like to be, altough each best practice could be confirmed and applied manually, this project has been started at first scope to help during the discovery. As first output, we are going to have two CSV files, in which we are going to have the recommended action items to cover and general information about the current system. 

These commands perform system read only operations, there are not modifications action involved, the only exeption are of two csv files created only to contain the final results.

* Notes:
    * Remember that when an application pool is activated then a new process called worker process is created, started and managed by IIS, is inside this process where the application code is executing.

The CheckIIS command performs the following validations

1. Validations applied over IIS application pools
    1. Recycling regular time should not be the default value
        * The default recycling time is 1740 minutes, then, an app pool recycling will happen during business hours at some moment, this could cause performance degradation and user sessions finished, (the user session finished problem could be mitigated wether ASP.NET keeps its session state out-proc, for example in SqlServer), the recommended value for recycling regular time is 0 (set to zero, this means that the recycling will not ocurr due to elapsed time), in addition to specifing a Specific Time, for example at 3:00am

    2. Recycling idle time-out should not be the default value 
        * The default recycling idle time-out is 20 minutes, this means that IIS will automatically shutdown a worker process after 20 minutes of inactivity, then when a new request arrives to the application, the full activation process starts again (craetion of a new worker process, ASP.NET pages and Dlls compilation, etc.), this could cause performance degradation and user sessions finished, if the server memory usage allows us, then, the recommended value for iddle time-out is 0 (set to zero, in other words, IIS will never shutdown an already running worker process due to inactivity time, it will be recycled only when other recycling conditions were meet)

    3. Identity should be the default value
        * The default identity used by the worker process is ApplicationPoolIdentity, and it has the required privileges to run almost any web application, in case that this account needs to be changed, we need to ensure that the selected account does not has more pricileges that minimun needed, never, under any circunstance, is recomended to leave LocalService and Administrator accounts to run worker process in production, this could over expose not only the application security our operative system security too

    4. At least one application in each application pool
    5. No more than one application in each application pool
        * As each the application pool starts a different worker process, this is the ultimate isolation layer between application in IIS, so, if some application is having performance issues, unhandled exceptions, causing thread contention and/or resource managment problems, then other applications should not be affected by this bad behavior, and that is true, well onlyt when each application is isolated in its own application pool.

    6. No aplications leave with `<compilation debug="true"/>`
        * Never leave accidentally (or deliberately) the `<compilation debug="true"/>` switch on the application's web.config file, doing so causes a number of non-optimal this to happen including:
            * ASP.NET page compilation slower. This translates into performance degradation
            * ASP.NET timeouts without timeouts. This transaltes into posible resource leaking
            * Code optimizations missings. Not all the available code optimizations are applied, then the code execution could be slower by 30%
            * For more good reasons to do not leave debug="true" please refer to [ASP.NET Memory: If your application is in productionâ€¦ then why is debug=true](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/tess/2006/04/12/asp-net-memory-if-your-application-is-in-production-then-why-is-debugtrue/) and [Don't run production ASP.ENT Application with debug="true" enabled](https://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/442448)

Example
-------
1. Go to [Powerops Releases](https://github.com/gioRodriguez/powerops/releases) and download the lasted Release (Source code zip)
2. Unzip the files locally
3. Open a PowerShell session in Adim mode
4. Go to the unziped folder powerops-version/
5. Build the project `PS > build.ps1`, this will create the `output` folder
6. Copy the `output` folder content to the target server to analyze
7. Tun a full analysis `PS > Run.ps1`
8. After a successful execution your are going to find two files
    * `HostName-Findings.csv` Contains all the action items related to IIS/ASP.NET operation best practices
    * `HostName-BaseLineInfo.csv` Contains general information about the current state of the system
        * System information
        * Hotfixes
        * Drivers
        * IIS information
        * .NETFX information
        * Installed componets information
        * Installed services

Notes
-------
You need to run this commands as an Administrator

Developers
-------
Any design improvement is welcome, any new idea is also welcome :)

Almost all the code in Powerops was designed and written through TDD, so, I encourage you to continue with this good habit

Setup development environment
-------

* Install [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester) (Pester is the ubiquitous test and mock framework for PowerShell.)
* To installation details please refer to [Pester Installation and Update](https://github.com/pester/Pester/wiki/Installation-and-Update)

to run the unit tests open a powershell as administrator and run `PS projectPath/test/> Invoke-Pester`
